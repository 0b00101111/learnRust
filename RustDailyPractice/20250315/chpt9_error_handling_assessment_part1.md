## Step 4: Assessment and Feedback

Let's go through the assessment one part at a time. I'll include time estimates for each section.

### Assessment 1: Multiple Choice Questions (5-10 minutes)

1. Which of the following is a characteristic of a recoverable error in Rust?
   a) It should immediately stop program execution
   b) It's typically handled with the `panic!` macro
   c) It's represented using the `Result<T, E>` type
   d) It indicates a programming bug

2. What happens when the `panic!` macro is called by default?
   a) The program prints an error message and immediately terminates
   b) The program unwinds the stack, cleans up resources, and terminates
   c) The program enters debug mode
   d) The error is logged but execution continues

3. What does the `?` operator do when used with a `Result<T, E>`?
   a) It unwraps the `Result` value or panics
   b) It converts the error type to match the function's return type if needed
   c) It propagates an `Err` value to the calling code and returns the inner value of `Ok`
   d) Both b and c are correct

4. When is the `unwrap` method appropriate to use?
   a) In production code with critical error handling
   b) In tests, prototypes, or when you're certain the operation won't fail
   c) When you want detailed error information
   d) When working with complex nested error types

5. What is the key benefit of creating custom types for validation?
   a) They allow direct manipulation of internal data
   b) They reduce the need for documentation
   c) They enforce invariants at the type level
   d) They always provide better performance

Please respond with your answers when you're ready, and we'll move to the next part.
